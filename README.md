# Refactoring For Machine Dignity

## In brief
We can allow enabling "machine dignity" to inform and generate a rich, and I'd even argue more comprehensive, definition of quality than is typically considered.

Aiming for that type of quality means asking ourselves two simple questions:

1. Would I want to perform this code myself if I were the machine?
2. Does this aid in the machine/program's flourishing?

At various points, we can adopt "lenses" that can generate quality in programs for given audiences:
1. Personal (Do I want to work with this code?)
2. Shared (Do others want to work with this code?)
3. Aesthetic (Does this code impress or inspire anyone?)
4. Civil (Does this code express a considerate worldview?)

The most common alternative is for quality to be stopped at lens 1 or 2, leaving 3 to industry luminaries and 4 to whatever company one happens to work for.
